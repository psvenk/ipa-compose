# ipa-compose

A script to convert
[SIL's IPA keyboard layout](https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ipa) to a format
compatible with the Compose key.

## Motivation

From my experience, Keyman does not work as expected in all programs (e.g.,
Signal Desktop)\*, and it also is not as versatile and cross-platform as the
Compose key (which can be implemented via IMEs and browser extensions in a
variety of environments). So, it would be useful to use the Compose key to type
in the International Phonetic Alphabet anywhere instead of relying on dedicated
programs where Keyman works properly or using online IPA keyboards.

Here is a guide for a simpler version of this setup that inspired this script:

\* This could be my fault and not Keyman's.

## Usage

Run the script and concatenate the output to your Compose file.
